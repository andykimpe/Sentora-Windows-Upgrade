please visite <a href="../../releases/">releases</a> page for download installers file

News you can now choose the installation folder

# Warning

dot not use install directory C:\zpanel

if for update Sentora 1.0.0 MarkDark Version to Sentora 1.0.3

dot not use install directory C:\sentora

in order to avoid providing a pack which is very bulky (4 GB 32 + 64bit) and to be able to allow the rapid update of this one

the installer provided is less than 10 MB

and download all the dependencies himself

so if you are in 64 bit

it will download the dependencies for the 64 bit version

for the version 32 bit and well it's the opposite

instead of having a pack of almost 4gb it will download less than 2gb

this and possible thanks to the use of the Inno Download plugin

this installer and available in multi language

but only English and French are fully translated

for other languages you would have good on the basic translation of inno setup

you can participate in the translation of custom messages

note only the languages present in inno setup can be added if you want to add a language that does not exist in inno Setup, you will first need to add the language in the inno setup project


default file inno setup english language
